		Demeter is the goddess of grain and the harvest. She was the daughter of Cronus and Rhea, sister of Zeus, who she had her daughter Persephone with. It was believed that she made the crops grow each year and is strongly associated with all types of agriculture and planned society. When Persephone was abducted by Hades, Demeter was so sad that no crops grew. After some negotiations, Persephone became bound to the underworld as Hades wife for one third of the year, representing the barren wintertime. Only when Persephone is with her mother do crops grow. Because of this, the dying and blossoming of nature is connected to Demeter.
