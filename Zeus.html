    	You are Zeus, King of the Gods. A natural born leader, you tend to excel at everything you do. With a high moral and ethical code, you always make the right decision. All this power also grants you unlimited love affairs, which can cause a lot of jealousy.

		Zeus is the king of the gods and the sky. After overthrowing his father Cronus, him and his brothers divided the world. He had a very strong sense of justice and law, and was the spiritual leader of the gods and mortals. He is also seen as a weather god, his weapon being a thunderbolt. He was married to Hera, who often became jealous of his many affairs. Zeus represents the laws of nature and regulated time like the changing seasons or day and night. He was a very paternal figure to mortals and watched over them tenderly.
